# GitHub Pages Setup

This document outlines the steps to set up GitHub Pages for the 111HDIP Platform.

## Setup Steps

1. **Repository Structure**
   - The repository has been set up with the basic Next.js project structure
   - Configuration files have been modified to support static export for GitHub Pages
   - A simple landing page has been created

2. **GitHub Actions**
   - GitHub Actions workflow files have been added to automate the build and deployment
   - The workflows attempt to build the project into a static site

3. **GitHub Pages Configuration**
   - You need to manually enable GitHub Pages through the repository settings:
     1. Go to https://github.com/senseihaiku/111hdip-platform/settings/pages
     2. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions" 
     3. This will allow the GitHub Actions workflows to deploy your site

4. **Local Development**
   - Clone the repository to your local machine
   - Run `npm install` to install dependencies
   - Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
   - Run `npm run build` to build the static site

5. **Deployment**
   - Once GitHub Pages is enabled, any push to the main branch will trigger a deployment
   - The site will be available at https://senseihaiku.github.io/111hdip-platform/

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the GitHub Actions workflows:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly
2. Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in the repository settings
3. Verify that the Next.js config has the correct settings for static export
4. Review the GitHub Actions logs for specific error messages
